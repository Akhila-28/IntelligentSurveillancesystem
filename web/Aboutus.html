        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>In recent years, many cameras have been installed in public spaces and everywhere where security is more important. It is not an easy task to track each object and find abnormalities. In our project, we are introducing intelligent video monitoring systems. These systems are constantly being developed, observed, and understanding keeps track of objects and classifies the data to find out abnormalities in real time systems able to warn against, alarming situations and information to first responders. Crowd Density Estimation using Machine Learning: This study proposed a ML based approach for crowd density estimation, which uses a regression model to predict an image. The crowd present in the input data is subsequently identified and measured using the post-processed object detection findings. The aim of this project is to count the people inside each bounding box, monitoring the crowdâ€™s movement over time, and spotting any unusual behavior. The results of this research could be utilized to send authorities or security personal alerts or notifications.</p>
